Chip16 Project
==============

The Chip16 emulation project home.

## What is Chip16?
An emulation project helping programmers write their first emulator, using a well-defined, relatively simple VM specification.

It also doubles as a cool target platform to write little games and demos on.

## Where to go
Head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/tykel/chip16/wiki).

You will find exchaustive information about the system, and a full list of opcodes to implement.

You will also find rationale for Chip16's development, as well as guides, soon.

## What to get
Sample ROMs (and there are many) will be uploaded soon :)

My work, excluding ROMs:
* [mash16](http://code.google.com/p/mash16) - my own emulator; best choice for Linux 
* [Js16](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~tk2010/chip16) - my alt. emulator, in-browser
* [tchip16](http://code.google.com/p/tchip16) - assembler
* [img16](http://code.google.com/p/img16) - image to sprite converter

Others' work (cherry picked):
* [RefChip16](http://code.google.com/p/refchip16) - [Refraction](http://code.google.com/u/refraction) (PCSX2 dev)'s emulator; best choice for Windows
* [hchip16](http://github.com/vahokif/hchip16) - emulator written in Haskell, for cool people
