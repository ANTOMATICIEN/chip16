Chip16 Project
==============

The Chip16 emulation project home.

Head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/tykel/chip16/wiki).
You will find exchaustive information about the system, and a full list of opcodes to implement.

Sample ROMs (there are many!) will be uploaded soon :)

My work, excluding ROMs:
[mash16](http://code.google.com/p/mash16) (my own emulator; best choice for Linux)
[Js16](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~tk2010/chip16) (my alt. emulator, in-browser)
[tchip16](http://code.google.com/p/tchip16) (assembler)
[img16](http://code.google.com/p/img16) (image to sprite converter)

Others' work (cherry picked):
[RefChip16](http://code.google.com/p/refchip16) ([Refraction](http://code.google.com/u/refraction), PCSX2 committer's emulator; best choice for Windows)
[hchip16](http://github.com/vahokif/hchip16)(emulator written in Haskell, for cool people)
