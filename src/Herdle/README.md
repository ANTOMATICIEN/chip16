# Herdle.s - a simple game

One of the early Chip16 games.
You play as a dog who must avoid a herd of sheep to reach the gate,
whilst keeping his number of steps below an ever-decreasing threshold.

Features progressive difficulty, and elementary graphics by my brother.

A screenshot is featured in the top-level README.
